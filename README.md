an interesting text / description about yourself,
a link to a picture / gif,
a list or table.

 good commit message is an art form in itself. Try to stick to the following rules:

Be short and descriptive
Always use english
The first word should be a verb: "add", "fix", "remove", etc.
Use imperative and present tense: "add shop page" instead of "added shop page"
Do not end your commit message with a period
When in doubt, describe why you did something instead of how: "fix typo" instead of "replaced the letter a with an e in the second word"
